Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Earthquake–Tsunami Events (2001–2022)
# 🌍 Exploratory Analysis of Global Earthquake–Tsunami Events (2001–2022)

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of global earthquake and tsunami events using real-world data.  
It focuses on identifying trends, relationships, and patterns between earthquake magnitudes, depths, and tsunami occurrences.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Analyze the frequency and distribution of global earthquakes.
- Compare characteristics of **tsunami** vs **non-tsunami** earthquakes.
- Examine how **magnitude and depth** relate to tsunami generation.
- Visualize trends in seismic activity across years.
- Provide meaningful visual summaries through data visualization.
